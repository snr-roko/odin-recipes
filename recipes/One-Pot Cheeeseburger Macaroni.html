            <li>1 cup flat-leaf parsley leaves and tender stems, chopped, plus more for garnish, optional</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occassionally, until softened 6 to 7 minutes. Add the garlic and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in the chili powder, smoked paprika, red pepper flakes (if using), 1 teaspoon salt and a few grinds of black pepper and stir to combine. Add the beef and break it up into small pieces with a large spoon; cook, stirring occasionally, until beef is cooked through and no longer pink in the center, 6 to 7 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and Dijon until combined. Pour in the chicken stock and 1 teaspoon salt, stir to combine and bring to a boil, 6 to 7 minutes. Add the elbow macaroni and cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has thickened and the pasta is al dente, 9 to 11 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the Cheddar and cream cheese until smooth. Fold in the parsley. Garnish with more parsley, if desired.</li>
